==========================
 Announcing Numexpr 1.4.2
==========================

Numexpr is a fast numerical expression evaluator for NumPy.  With it,
expressions that operate on arrays (like "3*a+4*b") are accelerated
and use less memory than doing the same calculation in Python.

What's new
==========

This is a maintenance release.  The most annying issues have been
fixed (including the reduction mal-function introduced in 1.4 series).
Also, several performance enhancements (specially for VML and small
array operation) are included too.

In case you want to know more in detail what has changed in this
version, see:

or have a look at RELEASE_NOTES.txt in the tarball.

Where I can find Numexpr?
